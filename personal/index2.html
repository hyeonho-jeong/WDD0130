        <p>By participating in art lectures, self-esteem was formed and a consensus was formed by narrowing the difference between generations that may occur in the learning field through art education, learning experience, and aesthetic experience. In addition, the social development of the elderly is carried out through friendship outside of learning, which helps most elderly people suffering from loneliness and depression to recognize their social existence. . In addition, it is hoped that leisure programs for the elderly will develop various programs as true culture and arts that actually value the lives of the elderly.</p>
