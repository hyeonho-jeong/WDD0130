      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Jeong’s Art Gallery is one of the best museums in the world. Jeong's Art Gallery runs an art museum education where you can discover the dynamics and experimentation of modern art and the value of art in everyday life. The educational program, with participants from various cultural backgrounds from infants to adults, aims to provide visitors with meaningful learning to experience modern art and communicate with society through art, and an open art museum for everyone. Jeong's Art Gallery can help visitors improve their understanding of art by doing real art activities, not just enjoying it with their eyes. It will also be an opportunity to realize the connection between art and society and to think about the role of art in the future society through the following activities. All activities will be provided free of charge to all visitors who purchase tickets to the museum. However, for smooth progress and preparation of materials, all activities can be made through reservation in advance. Even if you don't make a reservation, you can make a reservation on the same day, but if you run out of art materials and a large number of people participate, the on-site reservation may be restricted from participating in the activity. The art activities at Jeong's Art Gallery are divided into children, adolescents, adults, and seniors by age group. In addition, all training is conducted by professional instructors, so you have to pay a lot of money to take instructors' classes elsewhere. However, if you just pay a ticket here, you can get high-quality art education.
